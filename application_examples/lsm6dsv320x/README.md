# LSM6DSV320X

The LSM6DSV320X is a high-end, low-noise, low-power, small IMU, featuring a 3-axis digital low-g accelerometer at 16 g, a 3-axis digital high-g accelerometer at 320 g, and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, which offers the best IMU sensor with a quad-channel architecture for processing acceleration and angular rate data on four separate channels (user interface, OIS, EIS, and high-g accelerometer data) with dedicated configuration, processing, and filtering along with a dedicated high-g sensor for high-g shock and car crash detection.

The device enables edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced dedicated features such as a finite state machine (FSM) for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core (MLC) for context awareness with exportable AI features for IoT applications.

The LSM6DSV320X supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows automatically reconfiguring the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor.

The device embeds a dedicated accelerometer sensor with an independent channel and filtering for high-g acceleration detection that perfectly matches shock requirements for sports, concussion detection, shock detection, and a full range of car crash detection applications.
