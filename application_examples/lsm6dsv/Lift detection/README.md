## 1 - Introduction

This Finite State Machine (FSM) example implements the *lift* and the *de-lift* gestures typically used in laptop and convertible devices to signal the intention of the user to look at the device screen. It is typically used to automatically turn on and turn off the device screen. It uses the accelerometer sensor only.

The configuration runs at 30 Hz.

Configurable parameters:

- Lift angle, default is 20 degrees (0.342 g for X and Y axes, 0.939 g for Z axis)
- Lift time, default is 0.5 s (15 samples)
- De-lift time, default is 1 s (30 samples)


## 2 - Device orientation

Any orientation is supported.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

- FSM_OUTS1 register values
  - 08h = De-lift gesture detected
  - 10h = Lift gesture on +Y accelerometer axis detected
  - 20h = Lift gesture on -Y accelerometer axis detected
  - 40h = Lift gesture on +X accelerometer axis detected
  - 80h = Lift gesture on -X accelerometer axis detected


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when moving from a *lift* condition to the *de-lift* condition and vice-versa. Reading the FSM_OUTS1 (4Ch) register allows to determine the new state.
