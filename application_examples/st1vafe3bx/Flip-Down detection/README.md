## 1 - Introduction

Simple *flip-down* gesture example, used to stop the phone-call by placing the accelerometer Z axis downward.

The FSM processes data coming from the accelerometer, configured in ultra low-power mode at 25 Hz.

Overall current consumption is 10.5  µA.


## 2 - Device orientation

ENU, SEU, WSU or NWU orientation is required.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT when the *flip-down* gesture is detected.
