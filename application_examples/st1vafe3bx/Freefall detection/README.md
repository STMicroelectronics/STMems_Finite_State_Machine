## 1 - Introduction

Simple *freefall* detection example, used to determine when the device is falling down. The examples uses the accelerometer sensor.

The FSM processes data coming from the accelerometer, configured in ultra low-power mode at 25 Hz.

Overall current consumption is 11.2  µA.


## 2 - Device orientation

Any orientation.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT when the *freefall* is detected.
