## 1 - Introduction

Simple *shake* gesture example for smartphone devices. This gesture is detected when the user is shaking the accelerometer along the X-axis. 

The FSM processes data coming from the accelerometer, configured in ultra low-power mode at 25 Hz.

Overall current consumption is 10.7  µA.


## 2 - Device orientation

ENU orientation is required.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *shake* gesture is detected.
