# IIS2DULPX

The IIS2DULPX is an intelligent, digital 3-axis linear accelerometer whose MEMS and ASIC have been expressly designed to combine the lowest supply current possible with features such as always-on antialiasing filtering, a finite state machine (FSM) and machine learning core (MLC) with adaptive self-configuration (ASC), and an analog hub / Qvar sensing channel.
