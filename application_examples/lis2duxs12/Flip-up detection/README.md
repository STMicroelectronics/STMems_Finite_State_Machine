## 1 - Introduction

This Finite State Machine (FSM) example implements the *flip-up* gesture typically used in mobile devices to signal the event of flipping the device up when it is facing down on a table. It is typically used to automatically turn on the device screen.

The FSM processes data coming from the accelerometer, configured in ultra low-power mode at 25 Hz.

Overall current consumption is 10.8  µA.


## 2 - Device orientation

ENU orientation is required.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the *flip-up* gesture is detected.
